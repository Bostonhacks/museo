# BostonHacks Museum
This is the museum website for BostonHacks.

The museum site is made with Jekyll. To run it, navigate to the Jekyll website and follow their tutorial to get Jekyll and Bundler set up. 

GitHub Pages can server jekyll sites without any special work, so push any changes you want to go live into the gh-pages branch.
