# BostonHacks Museum
This is the museum website for BostonHacks.

The museum site is made with Jekyll. To run it, navigate to the Jekyll website and follow their tutorial to get Jekyll and Bundler set up.

GitHub Pages can server jekyll sites without any special work, so push any changes you want to go live into the gh-pages branch.

## Using Jekyll
This section is a work in progress... Needs better documentation.

Markdown includes data for pages, and html files include layouts. Make sure to use relative_url for media.

In order to start server, cd into the museo directory and run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Custom Bootstrap
Google for how to compile bootstrap from source, then do that in the bootstrap directory here. Copy the bootstrap files into the assets folder when they're ready.
