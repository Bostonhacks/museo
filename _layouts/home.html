        Tracks are optional specialized topics or technologies you can aim your project at. We'll have sponsors, workshops, and mentors to help you with your track-based project (as well as specialized prizes). Tracks are optional, make a hack you're interested in!
      <p> 
        Last year, our tracks were 1) Web and Mobile Development, 2) Machine Learning, and 3) Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.

        Check back soon to see what our tracks will be this year.
